* Track if a behaviour inherits it's described type in metadata
* Track example output in metadata
* Setup lighthouse
* TextMate issues (on the BAM and rob's MBP) (Still an issue?)

* make this sort of thing possible:

		# in spec_helper
		in_runcoderun = ENV["RUN_CODE_RUN"] # when this is true, run all normal specs PLUS the ":slow => true" specs
		
		Micronaut.configure do |c|
			c.add_filter :slow => true, :run_if => { in_runcoderun }

			# this would require changing focused to be something like this
			c.add_filter :focused => true, :run_exclusive => true
		end

		# then...
		describe FooSystem do
		 	it "does a lot of slow testing", :slow => true do
			end
		end
